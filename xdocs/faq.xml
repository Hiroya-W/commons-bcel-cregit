    <p>
      <b>Q: </b> Is the BCEL thread-safe?
      <br/>
      <b>A: </b>BCEL was (deliberately) not designed for thread
      safety. See <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/cp/">
      "Concurrent Programming in Java"</a>, by Doug Lea,
      for an excellent reference on how to build thread-safe wrappers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Q: </b> Can I use BCEL in a commercial product?
      <br/>
      <b>A: </b> Yes, this is covered by the <a
      href="license.html">Apache License</a>, if you add a note about the original
      author and where to find the sources, i.e., this URL.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Q: </b> (Typically for users of Xalan (XSLTC)) I'm getting

    <pre>
    ...
    ClassGenException: Branch target offset too large for short
    </pre>

     when compiling large files.
      <br/>
      <b>A: </b> The answer lies in internal limitations of the JVM,
      branch instruction like goto can not address offsets larger than
      a short integer, i.e. offsets >= 32767.<br/>
      The solution is to split the branch into in intermediate hops,
      which the XSLTC obviously doesn't take care off.
      (In fact you could replace gotos with the goto_w instruction,
      but this would help in the other cases).
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Q:</b> Can I create or modify classes dynamically with BCEL?
      <br/>
      <b>A:</b> BCEL contains useful classes in the
      <tt>util</tt> package, namely <tt>ClassLoader</tt> and
       <tt>JavaWrapper</tt>. Take a look at the <tt> ProxyCreator</tt> example.
