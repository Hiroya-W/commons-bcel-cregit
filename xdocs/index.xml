    The Byte Code Engineering Library is intended to give users a
    convenient possibility to analyze, create, and manipulate (binary)
    Java class files (those ending with .class). Classes are
    represented by objects which contain all the symbolic information
    of the given class: methods, fields and byte code instructions, in
    particular.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed
    by a program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. 
    An even more interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch 
    at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful 
    if you want to learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of 
    Java .class files. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    BCEL is already being used successfully in several projects such
    as compilers, optimizers, obsfuscators, code generators
    and analysis tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    It contains a byte code verifier named JustIce, which usually
    gives you much better information about what's wrong with your
    code than the standard JVM message.
